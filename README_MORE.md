This guide will help you get started on RakMagic.

## Client position
The client's position can be changed by server. To prevent it, go enable `keep_position`

The `!tp` command can be used to teleport to a player, while '!teleport' command can be used to teleport to an exact position 

## Follow a player
As same as most SA-MP bot cheats, RakMagic can copy a player's data, including onfoot packets, aim packets bullet packets

Before following a player, you need to switch the mode from ***Normal*** to ***Follow***, then use `!follow` command to set the player you want to follow 

Instead of copying vehicle packets, RakMagic enters the vehicle as a passenger. Notice that it always enters the first seat
