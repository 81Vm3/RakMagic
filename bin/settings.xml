	给中文用户的一个提示:
	A tip for Chinese users:
#########################

	如果你需要转码 GB2312 -> UTF-8 ，把interface-gb2312开启
	RakMagic 会把服务器发送过来的内容转换成 UTF-8 编码，然后显示在控制台 (绝大多数中文服务器使用GB2312)
	但是，在日志里的内容编码是不变的

		You can't change 'version' for joining a server that requires higher or lower client version. The only way to do so is change 'netgame'

	/> <!-- 
		Editing this field changes default animation
		'index' The index of the animation you want to apply (Use command !ganim to get index) (Set as zero for no animation)
		'loop' If set to 1, the animation will loop. If set to 0, the animation will play once.
		'lockx' If set to 0, the player is returned to their old X coordinate once the animation is complete (for animations that move the player such as walking). 1 will not return them to their old position.
		'locky' Same as above but for the Y axis. Should be kept the same as the previous parameter.
		'time' Timer in milliseconds. For a never-ending loop it should be 0.
